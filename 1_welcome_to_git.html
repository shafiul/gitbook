    <h2>Welcome to Git</h2>

<p>Welcome to Git - the fast, distributed version control system.</p>

<p>This book is meant to be a starting point for people new to Git to learn it
as quickly and easily as possible.</p>

<p>This book will start out by introducing you to the way Git stores data, to
give you the context for why it is different than other VCS tools.
This is meant to take you about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Next we will cover <strong>Basic Git Usage</strong> - the commands you will be using 90% of
the time.  These should give you a good basis to use Git comfortably for most
of what you're going to use it for.  This section should take you about 30
minutes to read through.</p>

<p>Next we will go over <strong>Intermediate Git Usage</strong> - things that are slightly more
complex, but may replace some of the basic commands you learned in the first
section.  This will mostly be tricks and commands that will feel more
comfortable after you know the basic commands.</p>

<p>After you have all of that mastered, we will cover <strong>Advanced Git</strong> - commands
that most people probably don't use very often, but can be very helpful in
certain situations.  Learning these commands should round out your day-to-day
git knowledge; you will be a master of the Git!</p>

<p>Now that you know Git, we will then cover <strong>Working with Git</strong>.  Here we will go
over how to use Git in scripts, with deployment tools, with editors and more.
These sections are meant to help you integrate Git into your environment.</p>

<p>Lastly, we will have a series of articles on <strong>low-level documentation</strong> that may
help the Git hackers who want to learn how the actual internals and protocols
work in Git.</p>
