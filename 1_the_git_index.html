    <h2>The Git Index</h2>

<p>The Git index is used as a staging area between your working directory
and your repository.  You can use the index to build up a set of changes
that you want to commit together.  When you create a commit, what is committed
is what is currently in the index, not what is in your working directory.</p>

<h3>Looking at the Index</h3>

<p>The easiest way to see what is in the index is with the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-status.html">git status</a>
command.  When you run git status, you can see which files are staged
(currently in your index), which are modified but not yet staged, and which
are completely untracked.</p>

<pre><code>$&gt;git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 11 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   modified:   daemon.c
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
#
#   modified:   grep.c
#   modified:   grep.h
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   blametree
#   blametree-init
#   git-gui/git-citool
</code></pre>

<p>If you blow the index away entirely, you generally haven't lost any
information as long as you have the name of the tree that it described.</p>

<p>And with that, you should have a pretty good understanding of the basics of
what Git is doing behind the scenes, and why it is a bit different than most
other SCM systems.  Don't worry if you don't totally understand it all right
now; we'll revisit all of these topics in the next sections. Now we're ready
to move on to installing, configuring and using Git.</p>
